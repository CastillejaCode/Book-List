Issues to learn from: Lack of consistency between components
Not using routing initially
Too much global state management
Css is wack, too much going on, not enough clsx
Could have just used autofocus but instead did a really weird implementation
Again, too much usage of rtk
Too much chaos when not defining function aheads of time instead of directly in the html tag
Needs more error handling
